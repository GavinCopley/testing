## What is N@TM?
Night at the Museum (N@TM) is an event at Del Norte where all of the art/coding/animation classes present our work to parents and other students. In the case of computer science, we present our projects that we have worked on throughout the trimester to our parents, other parents, and curious students. It is a very fun event which brings many people to view the projects at Del Norte.

## Me and My Team
We all spoke to the parents and students about the game that we created. We went over how it worked and everyone seemed pretty impressed that a group of 23 high schoolers could build this kind of game. Quite a few people wanted to play and they were all impressed with how the multiplayer worked and how the game played out. There was a few things that didn't work. The multiplauyer took a little to work because of how there are different servers. Also, thea leaderboard and chat both didn't work perfectly, but we managed to talk about it and explain how it was supposed to work.

## The Event
THere aws anther group in the room who had made a game similar to Little Alchemy. They made a game where you combined stuff to make other stuff by cooking it. It was a very well put together game and was vastly different from ours. Overall, the event was very fun and it was enjoyable to explain the game with Dean and Zafeer and learn about the other game.
