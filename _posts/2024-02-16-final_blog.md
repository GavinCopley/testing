## <a href="https://gavincopley.github.io/testing/games/snake">Snake Game</a>
This was the second project from the first trimester. This was a much more difficult task as this involved much more knowledge of coding and the various ways that these code pieces interacted in javascript. I had to scan throughout the code and look for things that I could customize and change to my liking. This was much more challenging but it was a very fun task. I ended up changing some colors around and it had fun finding ways to add the colors without messing up the game.

## <a href="https://gavincopley.github.io/testing/games/snake">Code Climbers</a>
This was the final project in which I worked in a team of 3 other people, Matthew, Ian, and John. We spent almost half of the total time messing around with javascript, making images, and planning. We spent a little too much time discovering that we hadn't actually made anything. Everyone else had spent lots of time following tutorials to make decent games while we were trying to create a project of our very own. I ended up doing almost the entire project myself because the rest of my group was not doing very much. However, this was a blessing in disguise as this was a super useful tool in teaching me javascript and its interaction with HTML. This helped me develop the javascript skills to take on the more challenging and time consuming tasks that I would eventually see in the second trimester.

## <a href="https://gavincopley.github.io/testing/games/snake">Platformer 2.0</a>
View <a href="https://github.com/GavinCopley/testing/issues/2">this issue</a> to see all that I have accomplished. This was the most fun project of computer science so far. I got assigned to the team in which we help integrate features of other teams will also coding our own additions into the game. I helped people like Zafeer and Ryan (from my previous group) in helping with their code (mostly Zafeer). This was an extremely fun project due to the challenges we faced and the way we had to work together to solve problems. As of writing this, we are not completely done, but I believe it is safe to say that this is one of the best classes in all of Del Norte.

#### Level 4
This <a href="https://github.com/GavinCopley/testing/issues/3">issue</a> is everything I changed about level 4. It highlights what I have done in concise bullet points.
